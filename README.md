Motrix is a full-featured download manager that supports downloading HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet, etc.

Motrix has a clean and easy to use interface. I hope you will like it 👻.

✈️ [Official Website](https://motrix.app) | 📖 [Manual](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/wiki)

## 💽 Installation

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/releases) and install it.

### Windows

It is recommended to install Motrix using the installation package (Motrix-Setup-x.y.z.exe) to ensure a complete experience, such as associating torrent files, capturing magnet links, etc.

If you use package management tools to manage applications on Windows, such as [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org), [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop). You can use them to install Motrix.

#### Chocolatey
Thanks to [@Yato](https://github.com/iYato) for continuing to maintain the [Motrix Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/motrix) package. To install motrix, run the following command from the `command line` or from `PowerShell`:

```bash
# Install
choco install motrix

# Upgrade
choco upgrade motrix
```

#### scoop
If you prefer the portable version, you can use [scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) (need Windows 7+) to install Motrix.

```bash
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install motrix
```

### macOS

The macOS users can install Motrix using `brew cask`, thanks to [PR](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/59494) of [@Mitscherlich](https://github.com/Mitscherlich).

```bash
brew update && brew install --cask motrix
```

### Linux

You can download the `AppImage` (for all Linux distributions) or `snap` to install Motrix, see [GitHub/release](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix/releases) for more Linux installation package formats.

Motrix may need to run with `sudo` for the first time in Linux because there is no permission to create the download session file (`/var/cache/aria2.session`).

If you want to build from source code, please read the **Build** section.

#### AppImage
The latest version of Motrix AppImage requires you to manually perform desktop integration. Please check the documentation of [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) .

> Desktop Integration
> Since electron-builder 21 desktop integration is not a part of produced AppImage file.
> [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) is the recommended way to integrate AppImages.

Deepin 20 Beta users failed to install Motrix, please follow the steps below:

Open the `Terminal`, paste and run the following command to install Motrix again.

```bash
sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

#### Snap
Motrix has been listed on [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/motrix) , Ubuntu users recommend downloading from the Snap Store.

Tips for v1.5.10

The tray may not display the indicator normally, which makes it inconvenient to exit the application.

Please unchecked Preferences--Basic Settings--Hide App Menu (Windows & Linux Only), click Save & Apply. Then click "Exit" in the File menu to exit the application.

Please update to v1.5.12 and above, you can use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>q</kbd> to quickly exit the application.

#### AUR
For Arch Linux users, Motrix is available in [aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/motrix/), thanks to the maintainer [@weearc](https://github.com/weearc).

Run the following command to install:

```bash
yay motrix
```

#### Flatpak
Thanks to the [PR](https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/2334) of [@proletarius101](https://github.com/proletarius101), Motrix has been listed [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.agalwood.Motrix), Linux users who like the Flatpak can try it.
